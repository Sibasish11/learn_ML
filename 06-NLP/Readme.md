# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This module introduces you to **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** ‚Äî the field of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.  
We start from text preprocessing and move toward **state-of-the-art Transformer architectures** like **BERT** and **GPT**.
