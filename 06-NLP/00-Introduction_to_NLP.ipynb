    "# Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to **understand, interpret, and generate human language**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It bridges **computer science**, **linguistics**, and **machine learning** to help computers interact with humans in natural ways ‚Äî such as through text and speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## üåç Real-World Applications of NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants** (e.g., Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT)\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis** (analyzing customer feedback)\n",
    "- **Machine Translation** (Google Translate)\n",
    "- **Spam Detection** (email filters)\n",
    "- **Speech Recognition** (voice typing, voice search)\n",
    "- **Text Summarization** (automatic report or news summarization)\n",
    "- **Question Answering Systems** (search engines, AI tutors)\n",

    "## üß† Why NLP is Important\n",
    "Natural language is **ambiguous, context-dependent, and rich in nuance**. NLP gives computers the ability to deal with these complexities. For example:\n",
    "- \"I saw a man on the hill with a telescope\" ‚Äî Who has the telescope?\n",
    "- \"Apple\" could mean a fruit or a company, depending on context.\n",

    "| **Lexical Analysis** | Breaking text into words and sentences. | Tokenization |\n",
    "| **Syntactic Analysis** | Analyzing grammar and sentence structure. | POS tagging, parsing |\n",
    "| **Semantic Analysis** | Understanding meaning of words and phrases. | Word embeddings |\n",
    "| **Pragmatic Analysis** | Interpreting context and implied meaning. | Sarcasm, tone detection |\n",

    "1. **Text Collection** ‚Üí Get raw data (tweets, reviews, documents)\n",
    "2. **Text Preprocessing** ‚Üí Clean and standardize text\n",
    "3. **Feature Extraction** ‚Üí Convert text into numerical vectors\n",
    "4. **Model Training** ‚Üí Train models (e.g., Naive Bayes, RNNs, Transformers)\n",
    "5. **Evaluation & Deployment** ‚Üí Test and use in production systems\n",
