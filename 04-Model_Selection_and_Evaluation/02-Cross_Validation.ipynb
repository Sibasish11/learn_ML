    "Splitting into just **train and test** may sometimes give an unreliable estimate. What if the test set happens to be too easy or too hard?\n",

    "## 1. What is Cross-Validation?\n",
    "- Cross-validation repeatedly splits the dataset into training and validation parts.\n",
    "- The model is trained and tested multiple times.\n",
    "- The results are averaged for a more reliable estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 2. K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "- The dataset is divided into **k parts (folds)**.\n",
    "- Train on k-1 folds, validate on the remaining fold.\n",
    "- Repeat for all folds.\n",
    "- Final performance = average across folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For 5-fold CV â†’ 80% training, 20% validation (rotating).\n",

    "## 3. Stratified K-Fold\n",
    "- Ensures class proportions are maintained across folds.\n",
    "- Useful for **classification problems** with imbalanced data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 4. Benefits of Cross-Validation\n",
    "- More reliable performance estimation.\n",
    "- Better use of limited data.\n",
    "- Helps in **model selection and hyperparameter tuning**.\n",
