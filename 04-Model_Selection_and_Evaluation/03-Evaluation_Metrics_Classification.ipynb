    "# Evaluation Metrics for Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving a **classification problem**, accuracy alone is not always enough. We use several metrics to evaluate models properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 1. Accuracy\n",
    "- Percentage of correct predictions.\n",
    "- Works well when classes are balanced.\n",
    "- Formula: **(TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Precision\n",
    "- Of all predicted positives, how many are correct?\n",
    "- Formula: **TP / (TP + FP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Recall (Sensitivity)\n",
    "- Of all actual positives, how many were correctly predicted?\n",
    "- Formula: **TP / (TP + FN)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. F1-Score\n",
    "- Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.\n",
    "- Good for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "- Formula: **2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Confusion Matrix\n",
    "- Table showing TP, TN, FP, FN.\n",
    "- Helps visualize classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. ROC Curve & AUC\n",
    "- ROC Curve → trade-off between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate.\n",
    "- AUC (Area Under Curve) → higher is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "These metrics help in comparing classifiers and understanding their strengths/weaknesses."
