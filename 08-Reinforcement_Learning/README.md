# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a fascinating area of Machine Learning where an **agent learns to make decisions** by interacting with an **environment** to achieve a **goal**. Unlike supervised learning (where labels are given), RL is all about **trial and error**, learning from **feedback** in the form of rewards or penalties.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will:
- Understand the **core concepts** behind Reinforcement Learning.
- Explore **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)** and their role in RL.
- Implement **value-based** and **policy-based** learning algorithms.
- Train agents using **Q-Learning, SARSA, and DQN**.
- Apply **Actor-Critic and Policy Gradient** methods.
- Work with **OpenAI Gym** to simulate real-world RL environments.
- Experiment with **advanced RL algorithms** like **PPO, DDPG, and SAC**.
