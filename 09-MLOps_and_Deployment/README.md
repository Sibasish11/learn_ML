# 🧠 09 - MLOps and Deployment

Machine Learning Operations (**MLOps**) bridges the gap between **machine learning development** and **production deployment**.  
It ensures that your ML models are not just accurate : but **reliable, scalable, maintainable, and reproducible** in real world applications.


## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

This section focuses on **end-to-end ML model lifecycle management** : from experiment tracking and model packaging to CI/CD and large-scale deployment.

By the end, you’ll understand how to:
- Version and track experiments for reproducibility.
- Package ML models for deployment.
- Serve models through **Flask**, **FastAPI**, or **Docker**.
- Automate workflows using **Airflow**.
- Manage deployments using **Kubernetes**.
- Monitor model drift and performance in production.
- Implement a complete **MLOps pipeline**.
