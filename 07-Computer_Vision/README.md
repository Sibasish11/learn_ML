# ðŸ§  Computer Vision: Deep Learning Module

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This module will introduces you to **Computer Vision (CV)** : the field of deep learning that enables machines to interpret and understand the visual world.  
You will learn how to process, transform, and analyze images, and then build neural networks to perform classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

By the end of this section, youâ€™ll be able to design a **complete CV pipeline** : from raw image data to a fully trained deep learning model.
